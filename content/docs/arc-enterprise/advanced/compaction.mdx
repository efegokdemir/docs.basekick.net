title: File Compaction
description: How Arc Enterprise merges small Parquet files into larger ones, and how a dedicated compactor node runs the schedule, min_files, and concurrency settings off the write path.
---

Arc's automatic compaction system merges small Parquet files into larger, optimized files for dramatically faster queries.

## Overview

Compaction is Arc's file optimization system that **merges small files into larger ones**, improving query performance by 10-50x.

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic** - Runs on schedule (default: hourly at :05)
- **Safe** - Locked partitions prevent concurrent compaction
- **Efficient** - Parallel, sorted merging by the query engine
- **Non-blocking** - Queries work during compaction
- **Enabled by default** - Essential for production

<Callout type="info">
Compaction is **enabled by default** and runs automatically every hour.
</Callout>

## Why compaction matters

### The small file problem

Arc's high-performance ingestion creates many small files:

```text
At a sustained high ingest rate with a 5-second flush:
→ one file per flush interval per measurement
→ 12 files per minute per measurement
→ 720 files per hour per measurement
→ 17,280 files per day per measurement
```

**Impact on Queries:**
- **Slow queries** - The query engine must open/scan hundreds of files
- **High costs** - More S3/MinIO API calls
- **Poor compression** - Small files compress less efficiently
- **Reduced pruning** - Less effective partition elimination

### After compaction

**Real Production Test Results:**

```yaml
Before: 2,704 small files (Snappy) = 3.7 GB
After:  3 compacted files (ZSTD)   = 724 MB

Compression: 80.4% space savings
File reduction: 901x fewer files (2,704 → 3)
Compaction time: 5 seconds
```

**Per-Measurement Breakdown:**
- **mem**: 888 files → 1 file, 1,213 MB → 239 MB (80.3% compression)
- **disk**: 906 files → 1 file, 1,237 MB → 242 MB (80.4% compression)
- **cpu**: 910 files → 1 file, 1,246 MB → 243 MB (80.5% compression)

**Query Performance:**
- **10-50x faster** - Single file scan vs hundreds
- **99% fewer API calls** - Massive cost reduction (2,704 → 3 LIST operations)
- **80.4% compression** - ZSTD compaction vs Snappy writes
- **Effective pruning** - The query engine can skip entire files

## How it works

### Compaction flow

```text
1. Scheduler wakes up (cron: "5 * * * *")
   ↓
2. Scan storage for eligible partitions
   ↓
3. For each partition:
   - Check age (&gt;1 hour old?)
   - Check file count (≥10 files?)
   - Check if already compacted?
   ↓
4. Acquire partition lock (SQLite)
   ↓
5. Download small files to temp directory
   ↓
6. Compact via the query engine (parallel, sorted)
   ↓
7. Upload compacted file to storage
   ↓
8. Delete old small files
   ↓
9. Release lock & cleanup temp files
   ↓
10. Repeat for next partition
```

### Partition structure

Data is organized by hour:

```text
arc/                              # Bucket
├── default/                      # Database
│   └── cpu/                      # Measurement
│       └── 2025/10/08/           # Date
│           ├── 14/               # Hour (2 PM) - Eligible for compaction
│           │   ├── file1.parquet (50 MB)
│           │   ├── file2.parquet (48 MB)
│           │   └── ...
│           ├── 15/               # Hour (3 PM) - Eligible for compaction
│           └── 16/               # Hour (4 PM) - CURRENT, skip!
```

Compaction merges all files in a partition (e.g., `2025/10/08/14/`) into one optimized file.

## Configuration

### Default configuration

Compaction is **enabled by default** in `arc.toml`:

```toml
[compaction]
enabled = true

# Hourly tier
hourly_enabled = true
hourly_schedule = "5 * * * *"   # Cron schedule: every hour at :05
hourly_min_age_hours = 1        # Wait 1 hour before compacting (let the hour complete)
hourly_min_files = 10           # Only compact if >=10 files exist

# Daily tier
daily_enabled = true
daily_schedule = "0 3 * * *"    # Cron schedule: 3 AM daily
daily_min_age_hours = 24        # Wait 24 hours
daily_min_files = 12            # Only compact if >=12 files exist

max_concurrent = 2              # Run 2 compactions in parallel
```

### Configuration options

#### Schedule

```toml
[compaction]
hourly_schedule = "5 * * * *"     # Every hour at :05 (default)
daily_schedule = "0 3 * * *"      # 3 AM daily (default)
# hourly_schedule = "0 */2 * * *"   # Every 2 hours at :00
```

**Cron format:** `minute hour day month weekday`

#### Minimum age

```toml
[compaction]
hourly_min_age_hours = 1    # Don't compact the current hour (default)
daily_min_age_hours = 24    # Daily tier waits a full day (default)
# hourly_min_age_hours = 2    # Wait 2 hours (more conservative)
# hourly_min_age_hours = 0    # Compact immediately (aggressive)
```

<Callout type="warn">
Setting `hourly_min_age_hours = 0` can compact the current hour while data is still being written, potentially creating many compacted files.
</Callout>

#### Minimum files

```toml
[compaction]
hourly_min_files = 10    # Only compact if >=10 files (default)
daily_min_files = 12     # Daily tier threshold (default)
# hourly_min_files = 50    # Only compact with many files
# hourly_min_files = 5     # Compact more aggressively
```

#### Concurrent jobs

```toml
[compaction]
max_concurrent = 2    # Run 2 compactions in parallel (default)
# max_concurrent = 4    # More parallelism (uses more CPU/memory)
# max_concurrent = 1    # Sequential (lower resource usage)
```

#### Memory limit and threads (per subprocess)

<Callout type="info" title="Available in v26.09.1+">
`memory_limit` and `threads` are configurable starting in Arc **v26.09.1**. On earlier versions each compaction subprocess inherits the full `database.memory_limit` and uses all CPU cores.
</Callout>

Each compaction job runs in an isolated subprocess with its own query engine instance. These keys bound that instance's resources:

```toml
[compaction]
memory_limit = ""    # Per-subprocess engine memory limit; "" (default) = auto
threads = 0          # Per-subprocess engine threads; 0 (default) = auto
# memory_limit = "2GB"   # Explicit cap
# threads = 4            # Explicit thread count
```

Env vars: `ARC_COMPACTION_MEMORY_LIMIT`, `ARC_COMPACTION_THREADS`.

**Auto behavior:**

- `memory_limit` derives as `database.memory_limit / max_concurrent`, so all concurrent compaction jobs together stay within roughly one `database.memory_limit`. With `database.memory_limit = "8GB"` and the default concurrency of 2, each subprocess gets `4GB`.
- `threads` defaults to half the CPU cores (minimum 1), so the default two concurrent jobs together use about one machine's worth of cores, leaving headroom for ingest and queries.

Accepted `memory_limit` forms are absolute sizes with a unit: `"8GB"`, `"512MB"`, `"0.5GB"`. Percent and unit-less forms are rejected at startup (DuckDB's `SET memory_limit` does not support them), as are other invalid values. The effective values appear in the startup log (`subprocess_memory_limit`, `subprocess_threads`).

When a job exceeds its memory limit, DuckDB spills to a `duckdb-spill/` directory inside the job's temp directory (under `compaction.temp_directory`) — size that volume for your largest partitions. Spill files are removed by normal job cleanup and by the crash sweeps on startup.

On a dedicated compactor node these can be raised well above the defaults, since compaction is not competing with ingest or queries for RAM and cores on that host.

#### Files per batch

<Callout type="info" title="Available in v26.09.1+">
`max_files_per_batch` is configurable starting in Arc **v26.09.1**. On earlier versions the batch size is fixed at 30 files and this setting has no effect.
</Callout>

A partition with more files than this is split into several batches, each compacted as an independent job producing its own output file.

```toml
[compaction]
max_files_per_batch = 30   # Files per compaction job (default)
# max_files_per_batch = 5    # Smaller outputs, more jobs per partition
# max_files_per_batch = 60   # Fewer, larger outputs
```

Valid range is **2–500**. Values outside it fall back to the default with a startup warning; `1` is rejected because compaction's adaptive retry cannot process a single-file batch.

This bounds the **file count** per job, not the output size in bytes — compacted file size tracks input file size, which follows your ingest buffer settings. The upper bound exists because a single `read_parquet()` call spanning too many files can abort.

#### Cycle timeout

One scheduled or manual compaction cycle runs under a wall-clock budget
(v26.09.2+). A cycle that reaches it stops launching work, waits for the
active jobs, and records the batches it completed, failed, interrupted and
never started, so a long backfill is not reported as job failures.

```toml
[compaction]
cycle_timeout = "30m"    # Positive Go duration: 90s, 30m, 2h
```

A longer budget does not reduce peak memory demand or guarantee that every
candidate completes; it only lets one cycle process more of them. A
scheduled tick that arrives while a cycle is still running is skipped, and a
manual trigger during a running cycle returns `409`.

#### Compression

Compaction always writes its output with ZSTD, which is why compacted files are
substantially smaller than the freshly-ingested files they replace. This is not
configurable per tier.

The compression used for **incoming** writes is separate, and is set by
`ingest.compression` (default `snappy`) — see the
[configuration overview](/arc-enterprise/configuration/overview/).

### Disable compaction

```toml
[compaction]
enabled = false
```

**When to disable:**
- Testing ingestion performance
- Very low write volume (&lt;10 files/hour)
- Debugging compaction issues

<Callout type="warn">
Disabling compaction will cause queries to slow down significantly as files accumulate.
</Callout>

## Monitoring

### Check compaction status

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/compaction/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "running": false,
  "last_run": "2025-10-08T14:05:00Z",
  "next_run": "2025-10-08T15:05:00Z",
  "stats": {
    "total_jobs": 42,
    "successful_jobs": 40,
    "failed_jobs": 2,
    "total_files_compacted": 12580,
    "total_bytes_saved": 8589934592
  }
}
```

### Get detailed statistics

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/compaction/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN"
```

### List eligible partitions

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/compaction/candidates \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "partition": "default/cpu/2025/10/08/14",
      "file_count": 150,
      "total_size_mb": 7500,
      "age_hours": 2.5,
      "eligible": true
    },
    {
      "partition": "default/mem/2025/10/08/14",
      "file_count": 120,
      "total_size_mb": 6000,
      "age_hours": 2.5,
      "eligible": true
    }
  ],
  "total_candidates": 2
}
```

### Manually trigger compaction

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/compaction/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN"
```

The manual cycle uses the configured `cycle_timeout`. Narrow it with query
parameters: `tier` (comma-separated, defaults to every enabled tier),
`database`, and `measurement` (v26.09.2+, requires `database`). The
database and measurement filters also scope manifest recovery, so a targeted
run touches nothing else.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/compaction/trigger?database=prod&measurement=cpu&tier=hourly" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN"
```

### View active jobs

## Performance impact

### Compaction performance

**Test Environment:** Apple M3 Max (14 cores, 36GB RAM)

| Files | Size | Compaction Time | Final Size | Compression |
|-------|------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| 888 | 1.2 GB | 2.1s | 239 MB | 80.3% |
| 906 | 1.2 GB | 2.2s | 242 MB | 80.4% |
| 910 | 1.2 GB | 2.3s | 243 MB | 80.5% |

**Total:** 2,704 files (3.7 GB) → 3 files (724 MB) in **6.6 seconds**

### Query performance

**Before Compaction:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM default.cpu WHERE time > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
-- 5.2 seconds (scan 720 files)
```

**After Compaction:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM default.cpu WHERE time > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
-- 0.05 seconds (scan 1 file) - 104x faster!
```

### Storage savings

```text
Original files (Snappy):  3.7 GB
Compacted files (ZSTD):   724 MB
Space saved:              80.4%
```

## Best practices

### 1. Let compaction run automatically

The default schedule (hourly) works well for most use cases:

```toml
[compaction]
enabled = true
hourly_schedule = "5 * * * *"
```

### 2. Monitor compaction jobs

Set up alerts for:
- Failed compaction jobs
- Partitions with &gt;1000 files
- Compaction taking &gt;10 minutes

### 3. Adjust based on write volume

**High write volume:**
```toml
[compaction]
hourly_min_files = 100   # Wait for more files
max_concurrent = 4       # More parallelism
```

**Low write volume:**
```toml
[compaction]
hourly_min_files = 5              # Compact with fewer files
hourly_schedule = "0 */6 * * *"   # Every 6 hours
```

### 4. Tune files per batch

```toml
[compaction]
max_files_per_batch = 30     # Files per compaction job (default)
# max_files_per_batch = 60     # Fewer, larger outputs
# max_files_per_batch = 5      # Smaller outputs, more jobs per partition
```

### 5. Reduce file generation at source

**Best practice:** Increase buffer sizes to generate fewer files:

```toml
[ingest]
max_buffer_size = 200000        # Up from 50,000 (4x fewer files)
max_buffer_age_ms = 10000       # Up from 5000 (2x fewer files)
```

**Impact:**
- Files generated: 2,000/hour → 250/hour (8x reduction)
- Compaction time: substantially reduced
- Memory usage: +300MB per worker

This is the **most effective optimization** - fewer files means faster compaction AND faster queries.

## Troubleshooting

### Compaction not running

**Check status:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/compaction/status
```

**Verify configuration:**
```bash
# Check if enabled
grep "enabled" arc.toml

# Check schedule
grep "schedule" arc.toml
```

**Check logs:**
```bash
# Docker
docker logs arc | grep compaction

# Native
sudo journalctl -u arc | grep compaction
```

### Compaction taking too long

**Symptoms:** Compaction jobs running for &gt;30 minutes

**Solutions:**

1. **Reduce files per batch:**
   ```toml
   [compaction]
   max_files_per_batch = 10  # Smaller compaction jobs
   ```

2. **Increase parallelism:**
   ```toml
   [compaction]
   max_concurrent = 4
   ```

3. **Reduce files at source:**
   ```toml
   [ingest]
   max_buffer_size = 200000
   ```

### Out of disk space during compaction

**Symptoms:** Compaction fails with disk space errors

**Solutions:**

1. **Use temp directory on larger disk:**
   ```bash
   export TMPDIR=/mnt/large-disk/tmp
   ```

2. **Reduce concurrent jobs:**
   ```toml
   [compaction]
   max_concurrent = 1
   ```

3. **Clean up old compacted files manually:**
   ```bash
   # Remove small files that were already compacted
   find ./data -name "*.parquet" -size -10M -delete
   ```

### Compaction locks not releasing

**Symptoms:** Partitions stuck in "locked" state

**Check locks:**
```bash
# View active locks
sqlite3 ./data/arc.db "SELECT * FROM compaction_locks;"
```

**Clear stale locks:**
```bash
# Locks expire automatically after 2 hours
# Or manually clear:
sqlite3 ./data/arc.db "DELETE FROM compaction_locks WHERE expires_at < datetime('now');"
```
