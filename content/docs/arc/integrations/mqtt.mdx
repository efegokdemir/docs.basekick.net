description: "Subscribe Arc directly to MQTT brokers: configure the broker connection, manage topic subscriptions through the API, and map JSON payloads onto measurements."
---

Ingest data directly from MQTT brokers into Arc. Connect to IoT devices, industrial sensors, and message brokers without middleware.

<Callout type="info" title="Available since v26.02.1">
MQTT integration with API-driven subscription management is available starting Arc v26.02.1 (February 2026).
</Callout>

## Overview

Arc provides native MQTT subscription with dynamic, API-driven configuration. Manage multiple MQTT brokers and subscriptions at runtime without server restarts.

**Key features:**
- **API-driven subscription management** - Create, update, delete, start/stop subscriptions via REST API
- **Multiple simultaneous brokers** - Connect to different MQTT brokers for different data sources
- **Topic wildcards** - Subscribe using `+` (single level) and `#` (multi-level) wildcards
- **Auto-detection** - Automatically detects JSON and MessagePack message formats
- **High performance** - MessagePack columnar format
- **Topic mapping** - Extract tags from topic path segments
- **TLS/SSL support** - Client certificates and CA verification
- **Encrypted credentials** - Passwords encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM
- **Auto-reconnect** - Exponential backoff on connection loss
- **QoS support** - QoS 0, 1, and 2

## Prerequisites

- Arc server running (v26.02.1 or higher)
- Arc API token (if authentication is enabled)
- MQTT broker accessible from Arc server

## Quick start

### 1. Enable MQTT in Arc

MQTT is **disabled by default**. Enable it via either:

**Option A — environment variable (recommended for Docker / Kubernetes):**

```ini
ARC_MQTT_ENABLED=true
```

In `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  arc:
    environment:
      ARC_MQTT_ENABLED: "true"
```

Or with `docker run`:

```bash
docker run -e ARC_MQTT_ENABLED=true ...
```

**Option B — `arc.toml`:**

```toml
[mqtt]
enabled = true
```

Arc looks for `arc.toml` in `.`, `/etc/arc/`, and `$HOME/.arc/`. In containers, editing the file inside a running container does **not** persist across restarts — use the env-var path or mount the file as a volume.

Restart Arc after changing either source. Verify with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/health
```

| Response                                            | Meaning                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200` with `{"status":"healthy", ...}`              | MQTT is enabled and running.                                                                             |
| `200` with `{"status":"disabled","healthy":false}`  | MQTT was not enabled at startup. Check `ARC_MQTT_ENABLED` / `[mqtt].enabled` and restart.                |
| `503` with `{"error":"MQTT subsystem disabled"}`    | Same as above, on older builds.                                                                          |
| Plaintext `Cannot GET /api/v1/mqtt/health`          | Your Arc build pre-dates the MQTT API. Upgrade to a release that includes PR #416 (v26.05.1 or later).   |

### 2. Create a subscription

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "factory-sensors",
    "broker": "tcp://localhost:1883",
    "topics": ["sensors/#"],
    "database": "iot",
    "auto_start": true
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "sub_abc123",
  "name": "factory-sensors",
  "broker": "tcp://localhost:1883",
  "topics": ["sensors/#"],
  "database": "iot",
  "status": "running",
  "created_at": "2026-02-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### 3. Send test data

Publish a message to your MQTT broker:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "sensors/temperature" \
  -m '{"time": 1706745600000000, "value": 23.5, "device_id": "sensor-001"}'
```

### 4. Query the data

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM iot.temperature ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 10",
    "format": "json"
  }'
```

## Message formats

Arc automatically detects the message format based on content.

### JSON single record

```json
{
  "time": 1706745600000000,
  "temperature": 23.5,
  "humidity": 65.2,
  "device_id": "sensor-001"
}
```

### JSON batch

```json
[
  {"time": 1706745600000000, "temperature": 23.5},
  {"time": 1706745601000000, "temperature": 23.6},
  {"time": 1706745602000000, "temperature": 23.4}
]
```

### MessagePack row-based

Same structure as JSON, but MessagePack encoded. Detected via magic bytes.

### MessagePack columnar (fastest)

```json
{
  "m": "temperature",
  "columns": {
    "time": [1706745600000000, 1706745601000000],
    "value": [23.5, 23.6],
    "device_id": ["sensor-001", "sensor-001"]
  }
}
```

**Performance:** Uses the MessagePack columnar format for high-throughput ingestion.

### Timestamp handling

- If `time` field is present: used as-is (auto-detects milliseconds/microseconds/nanoseconds)
- If `time` field is missing: current UTC time is used

## Measurement, tags, and fields

Arc derives the measurement, tags, and fields **from the message payload**, not from the topic structure. The topic itself is not parsed for the measurement name or for tag values.

For each decoded message:

- **Measurement** — taken from the payload's `m` field, or `measurement` field. If neither is present, it defaults to `mqtt`.
- **Tags** — taken from a `tags` object in the payload (string values).
- **Fields** — taken from a `fields` object if present; otherwise every remaining top-level key (anything other than `m`/`measurement`, `t`/`time`/`timestamp`, `tags`, `fields`) is treated as a field.
- **Timestamp** — from `t`, `time`, or `timestamp` (auto-detects ms/µs/ns); current UTC time if absent.

So to land in measurement `machine_metrics` with tags `line` and `machine_id`, publish a payload like:

```json
{
  "m": "machine_metrics",
  "time": 1706745600000000,
  "tags": { "line": "A", "machine_id": "42" },
  "fields": { "temperature": 71.5, "rpm": 1480 }
}
```

A flat payload with no `m`/`tags`/`fields` (e.g. `{"time": ..., "temperature": 23.5}`) is also accepted: it lands in the default `mqtt` measurement with the remaining keys as fields and no tags.

<Callout type="info" title="Topic-path extraction is not supported">
Deriving the measurement or tags from topic path segments (e.g. `tags_from_topic` / positional extraction) is **not** currently supported. Set the measurement and tags in the published payload as shown above.
</Callout>

## Topic mapping (per-topic database override)

`topic_mapping` maps an **exact MQTT topic string to a target database name**, overriding the subscription's `database` for messages received on that topic. It is a flat `{ "<topic>": "<database>" }` object — it does not configure measurements or tags.

Every target follows the same rule as `database`: it starts with a letter and contains only letters, digits, underscores and hyphens, up to 64 characters. Create and update requests with any other target are refused with `400`. The subscriber also re-checks the resolved database on every message, so a subscription edited directly in SQLite to an invalid name drops those messages, counts them in `messages_failed`, and logs the value once instead of writing under a name no query can address; a persisted subscription with an invalid target does not start and is left in the `error` status. Measurement names in payloads (`m` / `measurement`) follow the same rule as the HTTP write path (letter first, then letters, digits, underscore or hyphen, up to 128 characters); a message with an invalid one is rejected as a decode error.

```json
{
  "name": "factory-sensors",
  "broker": "tcp://localhost:1883",
  "topics": ["factory/line1/metrics", "factory/line2/metrics"],
  "database": "iot",
  "topic_mapping": {
    "factory/line2/metrics": "iot_line2"
  }
}
```

In this example, messages on `factory/line1/metrics` are written to the default `iot` database, while messages on `factory/line2/metrics` are routed to `iot_line2`.

<Callout type="info" title="topic_mapping keys match exactly">
The mapping key is matched against the message's actual topic by exact string equality — wildcard topic patterns (`+`, `#`) are not expanded for matching. A subscription may use wildcards in `topics`, but `topic_mapping` keys must be the concrete topics you want to route to a different database.
</Callout>

## Authentication

### Basic authentication

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "authenticated-broker",
    "broker": "tcp://broker.example.com:1883",
    "topics": ["data/#"],
    "database": "production",
    "username": "mqtt_user",
    "password": "mqtt_password"
  }'
```

### Password encryption

Passwords are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM. Set the encryption key:

```bash
# Generate a 32-byte key
openssl rand -base64 32

# Set environment variable before starting Arc
export ARC_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-base64-encoded-32-byte-key"
```

**Note:** The encryption key is only required when subscriptions have passwords. Subscriptions without credentials work without the key.

## TLS/SSL configuration

### Server certificate verification

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "secure-broker",
    "broker": "ssl://broker.example.com:8883",
    "topics": ["secure/#"],
    "database": "production",
    "tls_enabled": true,
    "tls_ca_path": "/etc/arc/certs/ca.crt"
  }'
```

### Client certificate authentication

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "mtls-broker",
    "broker": "ssl://broker.example.com:8883",
    "topics": ["secure/#"],
    "database": "production",
    "tls_enabled": true,
    "tls_cert_path": "/etc/arc/certs/client.crt",
    "tls_key_path": "/etc/arc/certs/client.key",
    "tls_ca_path": "/etc/arc/certs/ca.crt"
  }'
```

## Configuration examples

### Multiple brokers

Connect to different brokers for different environments:

```bash
# Production broker
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "production",
    "broker": "ssl://prod-mqtt.example.com:8883",
    "topics": ["prod/#"],
    "database": "production",
    "tls_enabled": true
  }'

# Development broker
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "development",
    "broker": "tcp://dev-mqtt.example.com:1883",
    "topics": ["dev/#"],
    "database": "development"
  }'
```

### IoT sensor network

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "iot-sensors",
    "broker": "tcp://mosquitto:1883",
    "topics": [
      "sensors/+/temperature",
      "sensors/+/humidity",
      "sensors/+/pressure"
    ],
    "database": "iot",
    "qos": 1
  }'
```

Devices set the measurement and tags in the payload — e.g. a temperature sensor publishes:

```json
{ "m": "temperature", "tags": { "sensor_id": "temp-001" }, "fields": { "value": 23.5 } }
```

### Industrial factory

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "factory-floor",
    "broker": "tcp://factory-mqtt:1883",
    "topics": ["factory/+/+/metrics"],
    "database": "manufacturing",
    "qos": 2
  }'
```

Machines publish the measurement and tags in the payload:

```json
{
  "m": "machine_metrics",
  "tags": { "line": "A", "machine_id": "42" },
  "fields": { "temperature": 71.5, "rpm": 1480 }
}
```

## Monitoring

### Subscription stats

```bash
# Stats for a specific subscription
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions/{id}/stats

# Aggregate stats for all subscriptions
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/stats
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "running_count": 2,
  "subscriptions_stats": {
    "sub_abc123": {
      "messages_received": 15420,
      "bytes_received": 2458320,
      "decode_errors": 0,
      "last_message_at": "2026-02-01T10:30:15Z",
      "topics": {
        "sensors/temperature": 8500,
        "sensors/humidity": 6920
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`last_message_at` and `connected_since` are **omitted** when the subscription has not yet received a message / is not connected (rather than reporting a zero timestamp). When present they are always UTC.

### Health check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/health
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "healthy": true,
  "running_count": 2,
  "connected_count": 2,
  "disconnected_count": 0,
  "service": "mqtt_subscriptions"
}
```

### Prometheus metrics

Arc exposes MQTT metrics for Prometheus:

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `arc_mqtt_messages_received_total` | Counter | Total messages received |
| `arc_mqtt_bytes_received_total` | Counter | Total bytes received |
| `arc_mqtt_decode_errors_total` | Counter | Message decode errors |
| `arc_mqtt_connection_status` | Gauge | Connection status (1=connected) |

## Querying MQTT data

### List measurements

```sql
SHOW TABLES FROM iot;
```

### Basic query

```sql
SELECT * FROM iot.temperature
ORDER BY time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Time-based aggregation

```sql
SELECT
  time_bucket(INTERVAL '5 minutes', time) as bucket,
  AVG(value) as avg_temp,
  MIN(value) as min_temp,
  MAX(value) as max_temp
FROM iot.temperature
WHERE time > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY bucket
ORDER BY bucket DESC;
```

### Filter by tag

```sql
SELECT * FROM iot.sensor_data
WHERE sensor_id = 'temp-001'
  AND time > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY time DESC;
```

### Cross-measurement join

```sql
SELECT
  t.time,
  t.value as temperature,
  h.value as humidity
FROM iot.temperature t
JOIN iot.humidity h ON t.time = h.time AND t.sensor_id = h.sensor_id
WHERE t.time > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY t.time DESC;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection failed

```bash
# Check subscription status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions/{id}
```

If status is `error`, check:
- Broker URL is correct (tcp://, ssl://, ws://)
- Broker is reachable from Arc server
- Credentials are correct
- TLS certificates are valid

### No data appearing

1. Verify subscription is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions/{id}
# status should be "running"
```

2. Check stats for received messages:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions/{id}/stats
```

3. Verify topic pattern matches published topics

4. Check Arc logs for decode errors

### Messages not decoding

Ensure messages are valid JSON or MessagePack:

```bash
# Test with simple JSON
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "test/data" \
  -m '{"time": 1706745600000000, "value": 42}'
```

Check for decode errors in stats:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions/{id}/stats | jq '.decode_errors'
```

### Subscription won't start

Check for errors:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mqtt/subscriptions/{id} | jq '.error_message'
```

Common issues:
- Another client using same client_id
- Invalid broker URL
- Network connectivity issues

## Best practices

### 1. Use descriptive names

```json
{
  "name": "prod-factory-floor-sensors",
  "broker": "ssl://prod-mqtt.example.com:8883"
}
```

### 2. Separate databases by environment

```json
// Production
{"database": "production", "topics": ["prod/#"]}

// Staging
{"database": "staging", "topics": ["staging/#"]}
```

### 3. Use QoS appropriately

- **QoS 0**: Fire-and-forget, no guarantees (highest throughput)
- **QoS 1**: At least once delivery (recommended for most cases)
- **QoS 2**: Exactly once delivery (highest overhead)

### 4. Cap the reconnect backoff

Reconnect uses an exponential backoff that starts at 1 second (fixed by the MQTT
client library) and doubles up to `reconnect_max_seconds`. Set the cap to bound
how long the client waits between attempts when a broker is down for a while:

```json
{
  "reconnect_max_seconds": 60
}
```

### 5. Use topic wildcards efficiently

```bash
# Good - specific wildcards
sensors/+/temperature
factory/line1/+/metrics

# Avoid - too broad
#
sensors/#/#
```

### 6. Monitor subscription health

Set up alerts on:
- `arc_mqtt_connection_status == 0` (disconnected)
- `rate(arc_mqtt_decode_errors_total[5m]) > 0` (decode errors)

## Docker Compose example

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  arc:
    image: basekick/arc:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - arc-data:/data
    environment:
      - ARC_ENCRYPTION_KEY=${ARC_ENCRYPTION_KEY}
    depends_on:
      - mosquitto

  mosquitto:
    image: eclipse-mosquitto:2
    ports:
      - "1883:1883"
    volumes:
      - ./mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf

volumes:
  arc-data:
