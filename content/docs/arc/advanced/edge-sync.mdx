title: "Edge Sync"
description: "Shipping Parquet files from an edge Arc spoke to a central hub over a network link or a signed air-gapped bundle, with resumable transfers and idempotent delivery."
---

<Callout type="info" title="Available in v26.09.1+">
Both sides ship in Arc **v26.09.1**, over two transports: a **network** link (spoke pushes to hub) and an **air gap** (a signed bundle carried on removable media, with a receipt on the return leg). Passes are **manual** in this release — you decide when one runs. The scheduled agent that runs them automatically is Enterprise and lands in a later release. See the limitations below.
</Callout>

Arc runs at the edge: a single binary with local storage in a vehicle, a factory cell, a mine site, or a forward deployment. **Edge sync** ships the Parquet files it produces to a central Arc — the *hub* — so data collected somewhere with intermittent connectivity ends up somewhere you can query it.

## The model

- A **spoke** is an edge Arc instance. It initiates every transfer; the hub never reaches back into it. That matters because edges usually sit behind NAT with no inbound reachability.
- A **hub** is a central Arc with the receive endpoint enabled.
- The unit of sync is a **file**, not a row. Arc already writes immutable, content-addressed Parquet, so shipping whole files gives end-to-end integrity for free and costs the hub no re-ingestion.

Connectivity is treated as the exception rather than the norm. A transfer interrupted mid-file resumes from a byte offset rather than restarting, and re-delivering a file the hub already holds is a no-op.

## Configuration

```toml
[edge_sync]
enabled = true                 # default false
hub_id = "ground-station"      # required when enabled
max_file_bytes = 536870912     # 512MiB default
max_reconcile_entries = 10000  # ~2MB per discovery batch
```

Environment variables follow the usual pattern: `ARC_EDGE_SYNC_ENABLED`, `ARC_EDGE_SYNC_HUB_ID`, `ARC_EDGE_SYNC_MAX_FILE_BYTES`, `ARC_EDGE_SYNC_MAX_RECONCILE_ENTRIES`.

### `enabled`

Off by default. Enabling it mounts `POST /api/v1/sync/file`, which accepts file writes from registered spokes — so it should be a deliberate decision, not something that appears on upgrade.

### `hub_id`

Names this hub, and is bound into every request's HMAC. A request signed for one hub is rejected at another, even when the spoke legitimately syncs to both and shares a secret with each.

Arc refuses to start if this is empty while `enabled = true`, because an empty value would let a request captured at one hub be replayed at another. It also rejects path separators, NUL bytes, control characters, and values over 128 bytes.

### `max_file_bytes`

Caps a single upload. This is a denial-of-service control rather than a tuning knob: Arc buffers a request body before authentication runs, so without a bound, anyone who can reach the port could pin memory without holding any credential.

It must not exceed `server.max_payload_size` (1GB by default) — the server limit is enforced first, so a larger value would never take effect. Arc refuses to start rather than let you configure a bound that silently does nothing.

### `max_reconcile_entries`

Caps one batch-discovery request. A spoke with a larger backlog sends several requests.

The bound exists for the same reason as `max_file_bytes`: Arc buffers a request body before authentication, so an unbounded batch would be a memory claim by an unauthenticated caller. Capping does not cost the property that matters — discovery is still one request per batch rather than one per file, so 5,000 pending files is a handful of requests instead of 5,000.

A batch above the cap is refused with `413` and the limit, so a spoke knows what to page under — the spoke's agent reads the limit from the refusal and re-pages under it automatically.

### `staging_sweep_max_age_hours`

How old an abandoned partial upload must be before the hourly sweep reclaims its staging space. Default `72` — deliberately longer than a plausible contact gap, because a staged partial is also the spoke's resume checkpoint, and sweeping it early forces a full re-send on exactly the links resume exists for. `0` disables the sweep.

## Registering a spoke

A hub only accepts files from a spoke it knows about. Registration generates the shared secret:

```bash
curl -X POST https://hub.example.com/api/v1/sync-spokes/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"spoke_id": "rocket-01", "name": "Rocket 07 Telemetry"}'
```

```json
{
  "spoke_id": "rocket-01",
  "name": "Rocket 07 Telemetry",
  "secret": "5db508a4…",
  "warning": "This secret is shown once and cannot be retrieved. Store it now; if it is lost, rotate."
}
```

**Capture the secret from this response.** It is the only time it is readable — the hub stores it encrypted and every later read returns metadata only. If it is lost, rotate rather than trying to recover it.

The `spoke_id` becomes the first path segment of everything that spoke writes, so it cannot contain a path separator, a dot prefix, or a NUL byte.

### Managing spokes

| Endpoint | Effect |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/sync-spokes/` | List spokes with their file and byte counters, and when each last reported in |
| `GET /api/v1/sync-spokes/{id}` | One spoke's metadata — never its secret |
| `POST /api/v1/sync-spokes/{id}/rotate` | Issue a new secret, returned once. The old one stops working **immediately** |
| `POST /api/v1/sync-spokes/{id}/disable` | Cut the spoke off, reversibly. History and counters survive |
| `POST /api/v1/sync-spokes/{id}/enable` | Restore it, no re-provisioning needed |
| `DELETE /api/v1/sync-spokes/{id}` | Remove the registration. Files it already sent are **kept** |

All of these require an admin token, including the read paths: the spoke list is a map of which edge deployments exist and when each last checked in.

<Callout type="warn" title="Spoke registration is unauthenticated when `auth.enabled = false`">
With Arc's authentication disabled there are no admin tokens, so **anyone who can reach the port can register a spoke and obtain working write credentials** for this hub. That is true of every Arc admin endpoint in that mode, but the consequence is sharper here. A hub logs a warning at startup when this applies. Enable authentication, or restrict network access to the hub.
</Callout>

Registering the same `spoke_id` twice is refused with `409` rather than treated as an update — silently reissuing a secret would lock out a live edge box with no signal.

### `ARC_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is required

Spoke secrets are encrypted at rest using the same key MQTT uses for broker passwords. A hub with `edge_sync.enabled = true` and no `ARC_ENCRYPTION_KEY` **refuses to start**.

There is no plaintext fallback on purpose: the sync database also holds audit logs, and a silent downgrade would leave every spoke's write credential readable to anyone who copied the file.

Encrypted rather than hashed because the hub must *recompute* an HMAC from the secret — unlike an API token, which is only ever checked against a value the caller presents.

## Discovery: One round-trip

`POST /api/v1/sync/reconcile` takes a spoke's pending set and answers which files the hub already holds:

```json
{
  "missing":   ["metrics/cpu/2026/08/07/14/a.parquet"],
  "present":   ["metrics/cpu/2026/08/07/14/b.parquet"],
  "conflicts": [{"path": "…/c.parquet", "their_sha256": "…"}]
}
```

- **`missing`** — send these.
- **`present`** — the hub already has this exact content. This is the lost-acknowledgment path: a transfer that completed but whose acknowledgment never arrived is discovered here in bulk, and the spoke advances without re-sending a byte.
- **`conflicts`** — the hub holds that path with *different* content. Surfaced for the whole backlog at once rather than discovered one `409` at a time during transfer.

The answer comes from a hub-side index of received files, not from reading Parquet, so it costs the same whether the hub holds a thousand files or a million.

## How a transfer is handled

1. The request is authenticated twice: an Arc API token, then a per-spoke HMAC binding the spoke, the hub, the path, and the content digest.
2. Bytes stream into a staging area while Arc hashes them.
3. The hash is compared against the digest the spoke declared.
4. **Only on a match** is the file promoted to its final location.

A mismatch is discarded at step 4, so corrupt bytes never appear where a reader would find them.

Files are stored under the spoke's namespace — `{spoke_id}/{original path}` — so two edges producing the same measurement for the same hour do not collide. The rewrite happens on the hub, so a spoke stays unaware of it and can sync to several hubs unmodified.

## Hub-side compaction of received data

Since 26.09.1 the hub's own compaction processes spoke namespaces (`edge_sync.compact_received_namespaces`, default `true`): registered spoke IDs expand into per-database compaction targets, so the small raw files spokes deliver are folded into ordinary compacted Parquet on the hub's compaction schedule — no protocol involvement, and hub queries over spoke data stop paying a growing small-files cost.

The sync protocol stays truthful: receipts for compacted-away files are **marked, never forgotten**. A spoke that re-offers one — a pruned ledger being rediscovered, or a stale air-gap drive imported late — is answered *already present* with zero bytes moved; a different-content re-delivery still conflicts. Three operational rules:

- Keep spoke registrations for as long as their data sits in storage: an unregistered namespace is not expanded (and, on a dual-role node, loses its relay exclusion too).
- Set the key to `false` if you rely on the raw per-file layout of received data (forensics, per-file external tooling).
- On a multi-node cluster, enable this only where the spoke-facing endpoint runs on the compactor node — receipt bookkeeping is node-local in this release.

## Dual-role nodes (hub + spoke)

An Arc can be a hub and a spoke at once — receiving from its own edges while syncing its own telemetry upstream. Since 26.09.1 the node's own sync discovery **excludes received spoke namespaces** (the registered spoke IDs), so other edges' data is never forwarded upstream double-namespaced. Explicit relay topologies are not supported yet. Two rules for dual-role operators: keep spoke registrations for as long as their data sits in storage (an unregistered namespace loses its exclusion), and don't name a local database the same as a registered spoke ID.

## Querying spoke data on the hub

Each spoke's data appears on the hub as a database named after the spoke. Spoke IDs typically contain hyphens, so quote them:

```sql
SELECT count(*), min(temp), max(temp)
FROM "rocket-01".engine_temp
WHERE time > now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
```

(Requires Arc 26.09.1+ — earlier versions had a query-layer bug where quoted identifiers resolved to nonexistent storage paths and returned zero rows.)

## Response codes

| Code | Meaning | What the spoke does |
|---|---|---|
| `200` | Committed, or already present with identical content | Marks it synced |
| `206` | Partial — the body ended early | Resumes from the returned offset |
| `409` | Same path, **different** content | Stops and raises an alarm; never retries |
| `413` | Above `max_file_bytes` | Configuration problem, not transient |
| `422` | Checksum mismatch; the upload was discarded | Retries from its own copy |
| `401` | Authentication failed | Checks `ARC_EDGE_SYNC_HUB_TOKEN`, then its secret and its clock |
| `503` | Hub-side failure, e.g. a manifest write during a Raft election | Retries later |

A `409` is deliberately not retryable. It means either two spokes are writing the same namespaced path or one side's bytes are corrupt — both need a human, and overwriting would destroy whichever copy is correct.

## Storage backend support

| | Local | S3 / Azure |
|---|---|---|
| Verify before commit | Yes | Yes |
| Byte-offset resume | Yes | **No** — restarts from zero |

Object storage cannot append to a block object, so a dropped transfer starts over. That is a throughput cost, not a correctness problem, and it only bites when a connectivity window is shorter than a single file transfer.

If you run a hub on object storage over intermittent links, lower [`compaction.max_files_per_batch`](/arc/advanced/compaction/#files-per-batch) on the **spokes** so individual files stay small enough to cross a window.

## Network-transport limitations

These apply to the network path described above. The air-gap transport has its own, at the end of this page.

- **Passes are manual.** A pass runs when you trigger one, via `POST /api/v1/spoke-sync/run` or a scheduler of your own (cron, a systemd timer, a link-up hook). The built-in scheduled agent is Enterprise and not in this release.
- **Uploads are buffered, not streamed.** A transfer is bounded by `max_file_bytes` and held in memory for its duration.
- **Abandoned partial uploads are not swept automatically.** The mechanism exists but is not yet scheduled, so a spoke that abandons transfers leaves staging files behind.
- **Deleting a synced file from hub storage is reconciled lazily.** Reconcile confirms that files its index claims are still in storage, and forgets the ones that are gone, so a spoke re-sends them on the next pass. Note that a retention policy whose database matches a spoke's namespace **will** delete that spoke's files — the namespace is the spoke ID, and retention operates on whatever database name it is given.
- **Hub-side corruption after commit is not detected by reconcile.** Files are verified before they are committed, but reconcile then answers from the index rather than re-hashing storage — re-reading every received file on every pass is exactly the cost the index exists to avoid. Corruption at rest is a storage-integrity concern, not a sync one.

## The spoke side

A spoke is an edge Arc instance that pushes its files to a hub. Enable it in `arc.toml`:

```toml
[edge_sync.spoke]
enabled = true                        # default false
hub_url = "https://hub.example.com"   # required when enabled
spoke_id = "rocket-01"                # this spoke's ID, as registered on the hub
hub_id = "ground-station"             # the REMOTE hub's edge_sync.hub_id
max_attempts = 5                      # attempts before a file is marked failed
max_concurrent = 2                    # simultaneous transfers
batch_size = 1000                     # files per reconcile round-trip; 0 = whole backlog at once
ledger_retention_days = 90            # prune synced/skipped ledger rows; 0 = never
```

A reconcile page the hub refuses as too large (over its `max_reconcile_entries` or its byte limit) is split and retried within the same pass, so no `batch_size` value can leave a backlog undrainable.

Both credentials go in the environment, never the file:

```bash
export ARC_EDGE_SYNC_SPOKE_SECRET="<the secret the hub returned at registration>"
export ARC_EDGE_SYNC_HUB_TOKEN="<an Arc API token on the hub with write permission>"
```

The secret drives the per-spoke HMAC; the token satisfies the hub's API-token middleware, which fronts the sync endpoints at write level. Without the token, every request against a hub running with authentication enabled (the default) fails with a `401` whose error text names the variable — only a hub with authentication disabled needs none. Arc **refuses to start** if the secret or token appears in the config file. One that is ignored still leaks, and leaving it in place makes the committed copy — the one that gets backed up and committed to a repo — look load-bearing.

`hub_id` must match the hub's own `edge_sync.hub_id` exactly. It is bound into every request MAC, so a mismatch fails *every* request with a `400` that looks like a hub problem; Arc validates it at startup instead of letting you discover it during a contact window.

### Running a pass

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/spoke-sync/run` | Run one pass and return what it did |
| `GET /api/v1/spoke-sync/status` | Pending/synced/failed counts, and sync lag |
| `GET /api/v1/spoke-sync/ledger` | Per-file state, attempts, and last error |

All three require an admin token: triggering a pass moves data off the box and spends whatever link budget it has.

```bash
curl -X POST https://edge.local:8000/api/v1/spoke-sync/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "discovered": 20,
  "recovered": 0,
  "already_present": 0,
  "sent": 20,
  "bytes_sent": 22015,
  "partial": 0,
  "failed": 0,
  "conflicts": [],
  "duration_ms": 19
}
```

A pass recovers transfers interrupted by a crash, discovers new files, reconciles the backlog in one round-trip, then streams what the hub lacks — **newest first**, so a contact window that closes mid-backlog has already delivered the freshest telemetry. It **pages until the backlog drains**: one pass on a spoke returning from a long outage moves everything, not just the first `batch_size` files.

Files are hashed once at discovery and the ledger is on disk, so a spoke restarted mid-backlog neither re-hashes nor re-sends what already landed. **Nothing is deleted from the spoke** — sync is a copy, and local retention stays yours to configure.

### When a tracked file vanishes before delivery

Compaction (on by default) rewrites raw Parquet and deletes the sources; retention deletes whole partitions. A file caught by either after discovery but before delivery has nothing left to send. The ledger marks it `skipped` — reported in `/status` and in each pass or export result — instead of retrying it into a permanent `failed` row, or (on the air-gap path) failing the whole export. Only a storage backend positively reporting the file gone triggers the skip; a transient storage error never does. Terminal rows (`synced`, `skipped`) are pruned after `ledger_retention_days`.

### Compaction waits for delivery

Since 26.09.1, local compaction on a syncing spoke **defers until the data has been delivered** (`edge_sync.spoke.defer_compaction_until_synced`, default `true`): only files the sync ledger reports `synced` — over the network, or acked back on the air-gap path — are eligible compaction inputs, and compacted outputs are recorded as already-delivered content that never syncs. The hub receives every row exactly once, as raw files; hub-side duplication from compaction cannot happen, and neither can compaction destroying rows the hub never received.

What that means operationally:

- A spoke with a sync backlog logs a per-scan deferral line, broken out by ledger state. `exported` means files are on a drive awaiting its ack; `failed`/`conflicted` need operator attention (see below); the partition compacts on the first cycle after delivery.

### Fixing stuck entries

A file that exhausts its retries — or hits a same-path-different-content conflict — lands in `failed` and stays there. Two admin endpoints resolve it:

```bash
# Transient cause fixed (hub reachable again, token rotated): retry with a fresh budget
curl -X POST https://edge.local:8000/api/v1/spoke-sync/ledger/requeue   -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"path": "metrics/cpu/2026/08/07/14/cpu_001.parquet"}'    # or {"all": true}

# Known-bad: stop surfacing it (pruned after ledger_retention_days; reversible via requeue)
curl -X POST https://edge.local:8000/api/v1/spoke-sync/ledger/dismiss   -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"all": true}'
```

To find what to requeue, list by state: `GET /api/v1/spoke-sync/ledger?state=skipped` enumerates the entries the default view hides — vanished sources, compacted outputs, and operator-dismissed failures, told apart by `last_error`. Any single state works (`pending`, `in_flight`, `synced`, `exported`, `failed`, `skipped`).

A dismissal marks the entry `skipped` rather than deleting it — a deleted row whose file still exists would be re-discovered next pass and come right back. It is reversible via requeue **while the file survives**: dismissing also makes the file eligible for local compaction (you renounced delivery, so the partition must not stay wedged on it), and once compaction or retention consumes it there is nothing left to requeue. Requeue a *conflict* only after resolving the divergence on the hub; otherwise it conflicts again and returns to `failed`. Both endpoints also unblock delivery-deferred compaction for the affected partition.
- An air-gap spoke's compaction cadence is bounded by its drive round trips — plan local disk for the gap.
- Compacted files that predate the upgrade sync once (their rows may exist nowhere else); a one-time duplicate for old partitions is possible, a loss is not.
- Setting the key to `false` restores the pre-26.09.1 behavior: compaction runs freely and hub queries double-count any partition whose raws synced before compaction consumed them. Flipping it back to `true` later is safe: anything compacted during the ungated period is treated as legacy and syncs once — a bounded duplicate, never a silent loss.


### Reading the results

`conflicts` is reported in full rather than counted, because each one needs a decision about which copy is right:

```json
{
  "sent": 0,
  "conflicts": [
    {"path": "default/cpu/2026/08/07/18/cpu_001.parquet", "their_sha256": "04ed50c9…"}
  ],
  "warning": "Some paths hold different content on the hub. These are not retried; investigate before re-syncing."
}
```

Conflicts are never retried and never overwrite: the same path holding different content means a spoke-ID collision or corruption, and re-sending would either be refused or destroy the evidence.

For anything stuck, `GET /api/v1/spoke-sync/ledger` shows attempt counts and the last error per file, so you do not have to open the SQLite database to answer "why is this not syncing?".

### Scheduling it yourself

Until the Enterprise scheduled agent ships, a timer is enough:

```bash
# Every 15 minutes, and on link-up.
*/15 * * * * curl -fsS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/spoke-sync/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN" >> /var/log/arc-sync.log 2>&1
```

A pass is safe to trigger concurrently with ingest and safe to re-run — one that finds nothing to do returns immediately.

## Air-gap bundles

Some spokes have no network path at all — a submarine, a classified facility, a vehicle whose data comes off on a physical drive. For those, a spoke writes a **signed bundle** to removable media and someone carries it to the hub.

```toml
[edge_sync.spoke.bundle]
enabled = true                        # default false
allowed_dirs = ["/mnt/usb"]           # REQUIRED; an empty list refuses every export
max_files = 10000                     # per bundle
max_bytes = 68719476736               # 64 GiB per bundle
```

This is **independent of `edge_sync.spoke.enabled`**. A fully air-gapped spoke sets only the bundle block — it needs no `hub_url`, and the network endpoints return `503`. A spoke that has both intermittent connectivity and a drive courier enables both and uses whichever is available.

You still need `spoke_id` and `hub_id`: both are bound into the bundle's signature, and the hub rejects a bundle that names a different one.

### Writing a bundle

```bash
curl -X POST https://edge.local:8000/api/v1/spoke-sync/export \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"path": "/mnt/usb"}'
```

```json
{
  "exported": true,
  "bundle_id": "06FXVSQXJ2C0EBDFDQ9D24S1E8",
  "dir": "/mnt/usb/bundle-submarine-01-06FXVSQXJ2C0EBDFDQ9D24S1E8",
  "files": 3,
  "bytes": 3285,
  "note": "Files are marked exported, not synced. They advance to synced when the hub acknowledges the bundle."
}
```

Optional `"limit": N` caps one bundle below `max_files`. A spoke with nothing new returns `{"exported": false, "reason": "nothing to export"}` — not an error, so a scheduled export does not look broken when the backlog is drained.

### What a bundle looks like

```text
bundle-submarine-01-06FXVSQXJ2C0EBDFDQ9D24S1E8/
  manifest.json     signed header: bundle ID, spoke, hub, entry digest, MAC
  entries.jsonl     one JSON object per file: path, sha256, size
  data/             the Parquet files, under their original paths
  ack.json          on a RETURNED drive only: the hub's signed receipt
```

`ack.json` appears after the drive has been to the hub. It is not covered by the manifest's digest — it cannot be, since it is created after the manifest is signed — but it is independently signed with the same per-spoke secret, so a replaced one is refused when the spoke reads it.

A directory rather than an archive, for two reasons:

- **Resume is free.** An interrupted copy leaves whole files, and the manifest's per-file SHA says exactly which landed — so resuming re-copies the mismatches instead of restarting. A truncated tar offers no such granularity.
- **It is auditable.** Someone has to inspect what crosses an air gap. `ls` and `sha256sum entries.jsonl` answer that without special tooling:

```bash
sha256sum /mnt/usb/bundle-*/entries.jsonl
python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('/mnt/usb/bundle-.../manifest.json'))['entries_sha256'])"
```

Bundle IDs are time-prefixed, so a directory listing sorts into creation order. They use Crockford base32 (no `I`, `L`, `O`, or `U`) because operators read them off screens.

### Where bundles may be written

`allowed_dirs` is **required**, and an empty list refuses every export. Every other Arc write path is confined to the storage root by its storage backend, but a USB mount is outside that root by definition — so this is the only thing bounding where an operator-supplied path can land.

- Paths are resolved through symlinks **before** the check, so a link inside an allowed directory cannot point outside it.
- Containment is compared at a path-segment boundary, so `/mnt/usb-other` is not treated as inside `/mnt/usb`.
- Arc **refuses to export into its own storage root**. The next discovery pass would otherwise find the exported copies and queue them for sync, fanning out on every export.

A refused path returns `400` and names the reason.

### Exported is not synced

Exported files move to a distinct ledger state. They leave `pending`, so a later bundle or contact window does not re-send them, but they are **not** `synced` — no hub has confirmed anything yet. `GET /api/v1/spoke-sync/status` reports them separately:

```json
{"pending": 12, "exported": 3, "synced": 40, "pending_bytes": 15728640}
```

`pending_bytes` still includes exported bytes. A file on a drive in transit has not arrived, and excluding it would make the backlog appear to shrink at exactly the moment nothing was delivered.

They advance to `synced` when the hub's acknowledgment comes back — which ships with the import side.

### When a drive does not arrive

```bash
curl -X POST https://edge.local:8000/api/v1/spoke-sync/export/06FXVSQXJ2C0EBDFDQ9D24S1E8/revert \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN"
```

Returns just that bundle's files to `pending`, so the next bundle or contact window carries them. Other drives in transit are untouched. `GET /api/v1/spoke-sync/ledger` shows each file's `exported_bundle_id`, which is how you find the ID to revert.

### Importing a drive on the hub

The other half. Enable it on the hub:

```toml
[edge_sync.import]
enabled = true                        # default false
allowed_dirs = ["/mnt/usb"]           # REQUIRED; an empty list refuses every import
max_files = 10000                     # refuses a manifest declaring more
```

Independent of `edge_sync.enabled`. A hub that only ever takes drives exposes **no** network-writable surface — `/api/v1/sync/file` returns 404. A hub that does both enables both.

```bash
curl -X POST https://hub.example.com/api/v1/bundle-import \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"path": "/mnt/usb/bundle-submarine-01-06FXW4H1BHR3XHWK2J826G28JG"}'
```

```json
{
  "imported": true,
  "bundle_id": "06FXW4H1BHR3XHWK2J826G28JG",
  "spoke_id": "submarine-01",
  "committed": 5,
  "already_present": 0,
  "bytes_written": 5475,
  "conflicts": []
}
```

**Nothing is committed until the whole bundle verifies** — the MAC, `entries.jsonl`'s hash, the canonical digest, every file's size and SHA-256, and the absence of any undeclared file (`ack.json` excepted on a returned drive; it carries its own signature). A tampered drive is refused and not one byte reaches storage.

| Situation | Response |
|---|---|
| Already imported | `409`, with when it arrived and how many files |

A **refused** bundle is never recorded as imported, so a corrected drive still works.

Conflicts are reported in full and never overwritten, exactly as on the network path: the same path holding different content means a spoke-ID collision or corruption, and one of the two copies is wrong.

### Why a duplicate drive is refused

Replay protection here is a **dedup ledger**, not a timestamp window. The online endpoints bind a nonce and a five-minute freshness check, which works because a request is in flight. A bundle legitimately sits on a drive for weeks, so the hub records every import keyed `(spoke_id, bundle_id)` instead — durable state that survives a restart, as a nonce cache does not.

Keyed by spoke as well as bundle, so a compromised spoke cannot burn IDs in another spoke's namespace and block its future drives.

There is no cleanup job: 200 spokes shipping weekly for five years is about 52,000 rows.

### Import history

```bash
curl https://hub.example.com/api/v1/bundle-import/history/submarine-01 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN"
```

Answers "did last month's drive ever arrive?" — which, on a link with no telemetry, nothing else can.

### Cluster mode

Manifest registrations are **batched at 1000 operations per Raft proposal**. The network path is naturally rate-limited to one proposal per HTTP request, but an import is a tight loop: a 2,500-file bundle costs 3 proposals rather than 2,500.

If a batch fails, the import aborts rather than continuing — a Raft quorum loss is not transient. The bundle is not recorded, so re-importing re-registers everything.

### The return leg: Acknowledgments

On a successful import the hub writes a signed `ack.json` **into the bundle directory**, so the drive going back carries its own receipt and it cannot be separated from the bundle it answers.

Plug the drive back into the spoke:

```bash
curl -X POST https://edge.local:8000/api/v1/spoke-sync/ack \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"path": "/mnt/usb/bundle-submarine-01-06FXWFA2NYJHJJFAJAXBDV4PKC"}'
```

```json
{
  "applied": true,
  "bundle_id": "06FXWFA2NYJHJJFAJAXBDV4PKC",
  "hub_id": "shore-station",
  "imported_at": "2026-08-07T21:59:56Z",
  "synced": 4,
  "conflicts": []
}
```

Those files move from `exported` to `synced`. **This is what makes them prunable** — without it `synced` is unreachable on an air-gapped spoke, so the ledger grows forever on the box least able to receive a site visit.

A full cycle looks like this:

```bash
after export:   pending 0   exported 4   synced 0
after import:   (hub holds 4 files, writes ack.json to the drive)
after ack:      pending 0   exported 0   synced 4
```

### What the acknowledgment guarantees

The ack is signed with the **same per-spoke secret** the spoke signs bundles with. The secret is symmetric, so the key that lets a spoke prove authorship lets the hub prove receipt — no new key material to distribute.

The spoke **recomputes** the path digest rather than trusting the one in the file. The MAC binds the digest, so a tampered path list carrying a stale digest would otherwise validate and license marking files synced that the hub never received.

Refused, with a `400`:

- an ack signed by a different hub, or naming a different spoke
- any path added to or removed from the acknowledged list
- a changed MAC, bundle ID, or import time
- an acknowledged path that escapes the spoke's namespace

**Conflicted paths are not acknowledged.** A conflict means the hub holds *different* content at that path, so your copy was never delivered — those entries stay `exported` and are reported for you to look at.

Re-applying an ack is harmless: already-synced entries are a no-op, so a drive plugged in twice changes nothing. A bundle that has not yet been to the hub returns `{"applied": false, "reason": "this bundle carries no acknowledgment yet"}` rather than an error.

Like the bundle it answers, an ack carries **no freshness window** — it rides the same drive back, over the same weeks.

### Air-gap limitations

- **Bundles are signed, not encrypted.** The manifest gives integrity and authenticity; the Parquet files themselves are readable by anyone holding the drive. Air-gap media is normally handled under physical controls, but if that does not hold for your deployment, encrypt the drive.
