title: "Backup & Restore"
description: "Back up Arc's Parquet data, SQLite metadata, and arc.toml through the REST API, track async job progress, and restore selectively from an existing backup."
---

Arc includes a full backup and restore system via REST API. Backups capture parquet data files, SQLite metadata (auth, audit, MQTT config), and the `arc.toml` configuration file -- with async operations, real-time progress tracking, and selective restore.

<Callout type="info" title="Available since v26.03.1">
Backup & Restore is available starting Arc v26.03.1 (March 2026).
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="Admin Required">
All backup and restore endpoints require admin authentication.
</Callout>

## Configuration

```toml
[backup]
enabled = true                  # default: true
local_path = "./data/backups"   # default: ./data/backups
```

## API endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/backup` | Trigger a full backup (async) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/backup` | List all available backups |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/backup/status` | Progress of active operation |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/backup/:id` | Get backup manifest |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/backup/:id` | Delete a backup |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/backup/restore` | Restore from a backup (async) |

## Creating a backup

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/backup" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN"
```

**Response (202 Accepted):**
```json
{
  "message": "Backup started",
  "status": "running"
}
```

The backup runs asynchronously in the background. Poll the status endpoint to monitor progress.

### Polling progress

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/backup/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "operation": "backup",
  "backup_id": "backup-20260211-143022-a1b2c3d4",
  "status": "running",
  "total_files": 1200,
  "processed_files": 450,
  "total_bytes": 5368709120,
  "processed_bytes": 2147483648
}
```

## Listing backups

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/backup" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN"
```

## Viewing a backup manifest

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/backup/backup-20260211-143022-a1b2c3d4" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN"
```

### Backup structure

```text
{backup_id}/
  manifest.json              # metadata: databases, measurements, file counts, sizes
  data/                      # parquet files preserving partition layout
  data/_schema/              # field schema anchors (v26.09.2+), copied with the data
  data/_compaction_state/    # compaction recovery manifests (v26.09.2+), copied before the data
  iceberg/                   # Iceberg table metadata, only when iceberg.warehouse is outside the storage root
  metadata/arc.db            # SQLite database snapshot
  config/arc.toml            # configuration file
```

Two counts in the manifest describe Arc's own state under the storage root
(v26.09.2+). `auxiliary_files` counts the field schema anchors under `_schema/`:
Parquet objects, so they are inside `total_files` and `total_size_bytes`,
but they belong to no database and are absent from `databases`.
`compaction_state_files` counts the objects under `_compaction_state/`: copied
before the data files, counted in the backup progress but not in
`total_files`. A recovery manifest that cannot be read while it still exists
fails the backup rather than being skipped, because a backup holding a
compacted output and its inputs with no manifest would restore both.

Iceberg table metadata that lives under the storage root (the default warehouse) travels under `data/`. A warehouse configured outside the storage root is walked separately and stored under `iceberg/`; the manifest records it as `iceberg_warehouse` with the source path, file count and size.

## Restoring from a backup

<Callout type="warn" title="Destructive Operation">
Restore overwrites existing data. Existing SQLite and config files are preserved with a `.before-restore` suffix before overwriting.
</Callout>

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/backup/restore" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "backup_id": "backup-20260211-143022-a1b2c3d4",
    "restore_data": true,
    "restore_metadata": true,
    "restore_config": false,
    "confirm": true
  }'
```

### Restore options

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `backup_id` | string | *(required)* | ID of the backup to restore |
| `restore_data` | bool | `true` | Restore parquet data files |
| `restore_metadata` | bool | `true` | Restore SQLite database (auth, audit, MQTT) |
| `restore_config` | bool | `false` | Restore `arc.toml` configuration |
| `confirm` | bool | *(required)* | Must be `true` to proceed |

### Selective restore examples

```bash
# Restore only data (keep current auth tokens and config)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/backup/restore" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "backup_id": "backup-20260211-143022-a1b2c3d4",
    "restore_data": true,
    "restore_metadata": false,
    "restore_config": false,
    "confirm": true
  }'

# Restore everything including config
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/backup/restore" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "backup_id": "backup-20260211-143022-a1b2c3d4",
    "restore_data": true,
    "restore_metadata": true,
    "restore_config": true,
    "confirm": true
  }'
```

### Compaction state

A backup taken while a compaction job was between uploading its output and
deleting its inputs holds both. Since v26.09.2 the restore reads the
backed-up recovery manifests first and does not restore the inputs of any
manifest whose output the backup holds intact (present, and of the size the
manifest recorded), so the restored store serves each row once from the
moment the restore finishes. The status endpoint reports them:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `consumed_inputs_skipped` | Input files the backup held next to the compacted output that replaced them; deliberately not restored. |
| `compaction_state_restored` | Recovery manifests put back. The next compaction cycle retires each one after firing its receipt hooks. |

A manifest whose output the backup does not hold, or holds damaged, keeps
its inputs; recovery then discards the manifest (and a damaged output) so
compaction retries. If
metadata was restored as well, restart before the next compaction cycle so
the staged metadata is applied first. A restored manifest older than seven
days logs compaction's stale warning once when processed; that is expected.
Backups taken by earlier releases carry no manifests to reconcile with.

### Incomplete restores

A restore that could not restore every data file ends with `status: failed`,
even though every file it could read was written and stays in place. The status
endpoint says what is absent:

```json
{
  "operation": "restore",
  "backup_id": "backup-20260913-175728-541f0e8c",
  "status": "failed",
  "total_files": 3,
  "processed_files": 2,
  "skipped_files": 1,
  "skipped_sample": [
    "backup-20260913-175728-541f0e8c/data/smoke/cpu/2026/09/13/16/cpu_20260913_175727_441274000.parquet"
  ],
  "error": "restore incomplete: 1 data files could not be read from backup storage and 0 files the backup inventoried were missing from it; the files that could be restored are in place, see skipped_sample"
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `skipped_files` | Backup objects that could not be read. Up to 32 of their paths are listed in `skipped_sample`. |
| `unaddressable_files` | Data files present in backup storage under names its listing cannot return, such as a dot-prefixed key an object store handed back at backup time. Up to 32 are listed in `unaddressable_sample`; rename them in the backup and re-run to recover them. |
| `missing_files` | Data files the backup's manifest inventoried that are neither listed nor unaddressable in backup storage: they are gone, for example after a partial sync or a deleted object. |
| `backup_skipped_files`, `backup_unaddressable_files` | Files the backup itself lacked when it was taken (see its manifest). Reported so a gap that predates the restore is not mistaken for one it caused; they do not fail the restore. |

There is no tolerated fraction: any skipped, unaddressable, or missing file fails the restore.
A write into data storage that fails (a full or read-only volume) aborts the
restore immediately rather than being skipped. Treat `failed` as final and read
the counts; re-running against the same backup reproduces the same gap until
the backup is repaired.

## Deleting a backup

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/backup/backup-20260211-143022-a1b2c3d4" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARC_TOKEN"
```

Deletion is refused with `409 Conflict` while a backup or restore is running -- deleting the backup a restore is reading would tear files out from under it. Retry once the operation finishes.

## Key behaviors

- **Async operations** -- backup and restore run in background goroutines with a 2-hour timeout. Clients poll `/status` for progress.
- **Serialized operations** -- only one backup, restore, or delete can run at a time. Attempting a concurrent operation returns `409 Conflict`.
- **Pre-restore safety** -- existing SQLite and config files are copied with `.before-restore` suffix before overwriting.
- **Destructive restore protection** -- restore requires explicit `confirm: true` in the request body.
- **Incomplete restores fail** -- a restore that could not restore every data file ends `failed`, with `skipped_files` and `missing_files` on the status endpoint; the files that could be restored stay in place.
- **What gets backed up** -- parquet data files, SQLite database (with WAL checkpoint for consistency), Iceberg table metadata when Iceberg export is enabled, and `arc.toml` config.
- **Iceberg warehouse outside the storage root** -- its metadata is restored into this node's configured `iceberg.warehouse` whenever `restore_data` or `restore_metadata` is set. The Iceberg catalog stores absolute paths, so the target node's `iceberg.warehouse` must be the same path the backup was taken from (a symlink to it works); a node with no such warehouse skips those files and reports them as `iceberg_warehouse_files_skipped` on the status endpoint. Restart promptly after a restore that includes Iceberg: the catalog snapshot is applied on the next start, and a reconciler still running on the old catalog can expire metadata the restore just wrote.
- **Clusters** -- Iceberg export runs on one node; a backup taken on any other node carries no Iceberg catalog or warehouse.
- **All storage backends** -- works with local filesystem, S3, and Azure Blob Storage.
