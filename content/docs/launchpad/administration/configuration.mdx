title: "Configuration"
description: "Environment-variable reference for Arc Launchpad: LAUNCHPAD_JWT_SECRET, LAUNCHPAD_BASE_URL, the SQLite path, private-endpoint policy, adapter-node proxy headers, and Mailgun or SMTP email."
---

All configuration is via environment variables. The only strictly required one is `LAUNCHPAD_JWT_SECRET`, without which the app refuses to start in production. Everything else has a sensible default or is optional. Email can also be configured in the UI (the first-run wizard, or the **Email** section under **Settings**), which is stored in the database and takes precedence over the email env vars.

## Required

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LAUNCHPAD_JWT_SECRET` | Secret used to sign session JWTs. Generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32`. **The app won't start in production without it.** In development it falls back to a well-known placeholder, which must never be used in production. |

## Recommended

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LAUNCHPAD_BASE_URL` | none; see below | Public base URL of this deployment. Used for links in emails and as the WebAuthn (passkey) origin. Set it to the URL users actually visit. |
| `LAUNCHPAD_DB_PATH` | `./data/launchpad.db` | Path to the SQLite database file. The Docker image sets this to `/app/data/launchpad.db`. |
| `LAUNCHPAD_DOMAIN` | `arc.localhost` | Display domain shown in the UI. Not wired through the Helm chart or the bundled Compose file; set it via `extraEnv` if you need it. |
| `LAUNCHPAD_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ENDPOINTS` | `false` | Allow registering Arc endpoints on private/localhost addresses. Must be the literal string `true` to take effect. See [below](#private-endpoints). |

<Callout type="warn" title="Get LAUNCHPAD_BASE_URL right">
This one value drives several behaviors that silently break if it's wrong for how you serve the app:

- **Session cookies**: the `secure` flag tracks the URL's scheme. On a plain-HTTP deployment served over `http://`, `secure` is off so the cookie persists; a mismatch can make login "succeed" then bounce back to the login page.
- **CSRF / `ORIGIN`**: the Docker image derives `ORIGIN` from `LAUNCHPAD_BASE_URL` when `ORIGIN` isn't already set; a wrong value causes form actions (including finishing setup) to fail with a 403.
- **Passkeys & email links**: WebAuthn is bound to this origin, and email links are built from it.

There is no single global default. `npm run dev` serves on `http://localhost:5173` and the dev-mode fallbacks assume it; the Docker image and Helm chart both default to `http://localhost:3000`. Set it explicitly to the exact scheme + host + port users hit (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` or `https://launchpad.example.com`).
</Callout>

## adapter-node / reverse proxy

Launchpad is a SvelteKit app built with `adapter-node`. It validates the `Origin` header on POST form submissions (CSRF). The Docker image handles this automatically by deriving `ORIGIN` from `LAUNCHPAD_BASE_URL`. For other cases:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ORIGIN` | The public origin, e.g. `http://localhost:3000`. Set this if you run `node build` directly (not via the Docker image). |
| `PROTOCOL_HEADER` | e.g. `x-forwarded-proto`, for a reverse proxy that terminates TLS and forwards the original scheme. |
| `HOST_HEADER` | e.g. `x-forwarded-host`, for a reverse proxy that rewrites the host. |
| `PORT` | Port the server listens on. Default `3000`. |

See the [adapter-node environment variables](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-node#Environment-variables-ORIGIN) reference for details.

## Private endpoints

By default Launchpad **rejects** Arc endpoints that resolve to a private, loopback, or link-local address (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `10.x`, `192.168.x`, `*.internal`, cloud metadata, …). This is an SSRF safeguard: the built-in proxy forwards requests to whatever endpoint you register, so untrusted endpoints must not be able to reach internal services.

Set `LAUNCHPAD_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ENDPOINTS=true` only when your Arc server is intentionally on a private network reachable from the Launchpad host (e.g. the same box, the same Docker network, or the same Kubernetes cluster).

Even when it's enabled, the proxy still resolves the target hostname and connects to a pinned IP address rather than re-resolving at connect time, which bounds exposure to DNS rebinding. Resolutions are cached briefly, so the pin is refreshed periodically rather than on literally every request.

## Email (optional)

Email is normally configured in the UI. As an alternative, operators can set it via env vars (the DB setting wins if both are present). Without any email config, transactional emails (invites, verification, password reset) are **printed to the server console** instead of being sent.

**Mailgun** (both `MAILGUN_API_KEY` and `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` are needed to activate it):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MAILGUN_API_KEY` | Mailgun API key. |
| `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` | Sending domain. |
| `MAILGUN_API_URL` | `https://api.mailgun.net` (US, the default) or `https://api.eu.mailgun.net` (EU). |

**SMTP (any provider)** — setting `SMTP_HOST` activates it:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server host. |
| `SMTP_PORT` | Port. Default `587`. |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | `true` for port 465 (implicit TLS), else `false`. |
| `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS` | Credentials. |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | From header, e.g. `Arc Launchpad <noreply@example.com>`. Defaults to a `noreply@` address derived from the provider settings. |

## Other optional integrations

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` / `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA on signup. Skipped if unset. |
| `GCHAT_OPS_WEBHOOK_URL` | Google Chat webhook for ops alerting on silent server-side failures. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Credentials for the Google OAuth callback routes. Setting them does not by itself add a Google button to the login page. |

## Put it behind TLS

For anything beyond local testing, run Launchpad behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS, and set `LAUNCHPAD_BASE_URL` to your public HTTPS URL so cookies, CSRF, email links, and passkey origins all line up. If you're already using Traefik for Arc, the same pattern extends cleanly to Launchpad; see the [Traefik + Let's Encrypt guide](https://basekick.net/blog/arc-traefik?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=launchpad).
