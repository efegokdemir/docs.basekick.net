title: "Retention policies"
description: "Create Arc retention policies from the Retention tab: scope them to a database or measurement, set retention and buffer periods, preview deletions with a dry-run, then execute or schedule them."
---

Retention policies delete aged data automatically, so storage doesn't grow without bound. Launchpad drives Arc's admin API to create and run them from the **Retention** tab, with no config files and no curl.

## Create a policy

Click **Create Policy** and configure:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Database** | Which database the policy applies to. |
| **Measurement** | Optional. A specific measurement (table); leave it as **All measurements** to cover the whole database. |
| **Retention Period (days)** | How long to keep data. Anything older than the cutoff becomes eligible for deletion. |
| **Buffer Period (days)** | An optional grace window beyond the retention period before data is actually removed. |
| **Enable policy immediately** | Whether the policy runs on its own, or is created paused. |

## Dry-run before you delete

Before anything is removed, Launchpad runs a **dry-run** for you. Opening **Execute Now** first shows **Dry-Run Results**: the records and files the policy *would* delete, the cutoff date, and the affected measurements, so you're never guessing about the blast radius. Review it, then confirm to execute for real. When the dry-run finds nothing to delete, the execute button stays disabled.

## Run and manage

Each policy card shows its target (database + measurement), retention period, buffer period, last execution time, and last-deleted count. From the card you can:

- **Edit**: change the periods or scope
- **Pause** / **Activate**: toggle whether it runs automatically
- **Execute Now**: dry-run, then run it on demand
- **Delete**: remove the policy

An expanded policy card also lists its past runs.

<Callout type="idea" title="Requires admin">
Retention management drives Arc's admin API, so the connection must use an admin-scoped token. See [Connecting to Arc](/launchpad/getting-started/connecting-to-arc/#getting-the-arc-admin-token).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Availability">
If the tab reports that retention policies are not available, retention isn't enabled on that Arc instance. Enable the `retention` section in its `arc.toml` and reconnect.
