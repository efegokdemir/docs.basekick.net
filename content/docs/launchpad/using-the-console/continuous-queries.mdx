Continuous queries roll up and downsample data on a schedule: read from a source, aggregate over a window, and materialize the result into a destination measurement. They're how you keep long-term storage cheap while preserving the summaries you actually query.

## Create a continuous query

From the **Continuous Queries** tab, click **Create Query** and configure:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Database** | The database the query runs in. |
| **Source Measurement** | The measurement to read from. |
| **Destination Measurement** | Where the aggregated result is written. |
| **Interval** | How often the query runs, chosen from the interval picker. |
| **Delete Source After (days)** | Optional. Drop the raw source data this many days after it has been aggregated. |
| **Retention Days** | Optional. Drop the rolled-up data after this many days too, to cap storage. |
| **Enable query immediately** | Whether it runs on a schedule, or is created paused. |

The query body must reference the `{start_time}` and `{end_time}` placeholders, which Launchpad substitutes with the bounds of each run's window.

## Run and manage

Each continuous query can be **Edited**, **Executed Now** on demand, paused with **Pause** / **Activate**, or **Deleted**. The execute dialog offers a dry run that previews the query without writing anything, so you can check a rollup before it materializes. Run one manually to backfill or test it, then enable it to run continuously.

<Callout type="info" title="Availability">
Continuous queries depend on Arc's support for them on that instance. If the tab shows "Continuous Queries Not Available", the connected Arc version or configuration doesn't expose the feature.

Managing continuous queries requires an admin-scoped connection.
